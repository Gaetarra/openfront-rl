# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Deep-RL bot for OpenFront.io. The design, phases, gates and every decision taken so far are in `docs/PLAN.md`:
read it before starting new work, and update it when a decision changes.

## Conventions

- Commits and PRs are authored by the repo owner. **Never add `Co-Authored-By: Claude` or any other Claude
  attribution line to commit messages or PR descriptions.**
- Never edit anything inside the game submodule `OpenFront_Source_Code/openfrontio/`. It must stay a clean checkout of
  an official release tag. Our code lives in `bridge/` (TypeScript), `trainer/` (Python) and `scripts/`.
- Game rule values (costs, ranges, radii, speeds) are read from the game's `Config` at runtime, never hard-coded,
  so balance patches flow through automatically.

## Game version

The submodule is pinned to the production release the official servers run (currently `v0.34.21`, commit `d7075bfa`).
Check what production runs by reading `gitCommit` from a recent record:
`https://api.openfront.io/public/game/<id>?turns=false` (list games via `/public/games`, see the game's `docs/API.md`).
To upgrade, follow the playbook in `docs/PLAN.md` (decision 14): diff `src/core` between the tags, move the submodule,
run the bridge tests and determinism check, then fine-tune from the latest checkpoint.

## Game commands (run inside `OpenFront_Source_Code/openfrontio/`)

```bash
npx -y npm@12.1.0 ci --ignore-scripts         # install deps: v0.34.21+ needs npm >= 12.1 (engine-strict), the PC has 11;
                                               # never use npm install
npm run perf:game -- --map world --ticks 1800 --bots 400    # headless full-game benchmark
npm run replay:game -- <gameID|record.json> --api-base https://api.openfront.io/public   # re-simulate a record, verify hashes
npx vitest tests/SomeTest.test.ts --run        # one game test file
```

The game has its own `CLAUDE.md` with details on its architecture.

## Bridge commands (run inside `OpenFront_Source_Code/openfrontio/`, which provides `tsx` and the tsconfig paths)

```bash
node --import tsx --test "../../bridge/*.test.ts"              # all bridge tests (node:test)
node --import tsx --test ../../bridge/game.test.ts             # one test file
node node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc -p ../../tsconfig.json    # typecheck bridge/ (tsx does not typecheck)
```

## Benchmarks (Phase 0 results are in `docs/PLAN.md`)

```bash
npx tsx ../../scripts/bench_env.ts <record.json> [--pipe]   # env-step cost on a real record (run from the game dir)
.venv/Scripts/python scripts/bench_gpu.py                   # GPU encoder throughput (run from the repo root)
```

Python: `.venv` at the repo root, `pip install -r requirements.txt` (PyTorch CUDA 13.0 wheels).

## Training commands (repo root)

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python -m unittest discover -s trainer -t .      # trainer tests (start real Node workers, need the GPU)
.venv/Scripts/python -m trainer.ppo --run onion                 # train; control page with the key curves: http://127.0.0.1:8787
.venv/Scripts/python -m trainer.ppo --run onion --resume        # continue from checkpoints/onion/latest.pt
.venv/Scripts/python -m trainer.ctl pause|resume|save|stop|throttle half|status
.venv/Scripts/python -m trainer.crawl                          # download ranked 1v1 records into data/ (hours: detach)
.venv/Scripts/python -m trainer.crawl --purge                  # remove deleted players' records (daily while data is kept)
.venv/Scripts/python -m trainer.bc --run bc                     # behaviour cloning on the records; same control page
.venv/Scripts/python -m trainer.eval --a checkpoints/bc/update0060000.pt --b scripted   # ranked 1v1 match, 256 games
.venv/Scripts/python -m trainer.eval --setup onion --a random   # Phase 1 setup: one seat vs 3 Easy nations
.venv/Scripts/python -m trainer.ppo --run ppo-bc2 --setup ranked1v1 --init checkpoints/bc/update0060000.pt --opponent checkpoints/bc/update0060000.pt --kl-coef 0.2 --lr 1e-4 --ent-coef 0 --workers 16 --games-per-worker 2 --updates 5000   # PPO from the Gate A clone (settings: docs/PLAN.md, Phase 2 results)
.venv/Scripts/python -m trainer.eval --a checkpoints/bc/update0060000.pt --b random --episodes 8 --record 1   # save games to replays/
.venv/Scripts/python -m trainer.watch                          # serve replays/ to the game's dev client (npm run dev)
.venv/Scripts/python scripts/diag_baselines.py                  # random vs scripted expansion (Phase 1 diagnosis)
.venv/Scripts/tensorboard --logdir runs                         # charts, incl. actions/* mix and episodes/* ranks
```

- Claude Code kills its background tasks when the session ends, and a training run started as one dies with it. Start
  runs longer than a few minutes detached: a short Python launcher calling `subprocess.Popen([...], stdout=log,
  stderr=log, creationflags=CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP | CREATE_NO_WINDOW | CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB)`, or the user's own
  terminal. Detached runs are still controlled via the page / `trainer.ctl`. (Surviving a session restart is not yet
  verified.)
- The PC's NVIDIA driver occasionally fails (System event nvlddmkm 153) and kills every CUDA program. Checkpoints are
  atomic, and the trainer exits 0 on stop, Save & quit or Ctrl+C and 1 on a crash, so long runs go in a PowerShell
  restart loop: `for ($i = 1; $i -le 5; $i++) { .venv/Scripts/python -m trainer.ppo --run <name> --resume --updates <N>;
  if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) { break }; Start-Sleep 60 }` (a new run starts once without `--resume`; it checkpoints
  every 25 updates).
- `--resume` keeps the checkpoint's settings except `KEEP_ON_RESUME` (`trainer/ppo.py`, `trainer/bc.py`) and, for PPO,
  a given `--kl-coef`; other flags are ignored.
- Training runs and `trainer.watch` all serve on port 8787: stop `trainer.watch` before starting a run (a running
  trainer serves `replays/` itself).

## Simulation facts the bridge relies on

- 10 ticks = 1 s of game time. One turn is executed per tick.
- Stepping: `createGameRunner(gameStart, clientID, mapLoader, callback)` (`src/core/GameRunner.ts`), then per tick
  `runner.addTurn({ turnNumber, intents })` and `runner.executeNextTick()`. Intents are `StampedIntent`s
  (intent + the player's `clientID`), defined in `src/core/Schemas.ts`.
- Use `GameType.Private` or `Public` for training games: Singleplayer has no spawn timer.
- Determinism: the core uses `PseudoRandom` (never `Math.random`) and `src/core/DetMath.ts` instead of
  `Math.exp/log/pow/atan2`. Anything we add that feeds the simulation must follow the same rules.
- Ownership: `game.map().tileStateBuffer()` is a live `Uint16Array` (owner = `v & 0xFFF`, fallout = bit 13).
  Read it only between ticks. Each tick's changed tiles arrive as `[tileRef, state]` pairs in the runner callback's
  `packedTileUpdates`; update only the cells they touch (a full rebuild costs over half of the sim time).
- The game logs with `console.log`: a process whose stdout carries frames must redirect it to stderr.
- A game's RNG is seeded from its game ID (as in the game's client), so training games get a valid 8-character ID from
  their seed (`bridge/setups.ts: gameIdOf`) and `EnvGame.fromStart` builds env games and replayed records alike. A
  recorded game (`EnvGame.record/toRecord`) replays in the game's own client.
- All games of a trainer share one padded cell grid (`gridFor`: 192 x 256 for ranked 1v1). Cell indexes everywhere
  are grid indexes y x W + x; padding cells hold no tiles.
- Records store only non-empty turns: expand them with `decompressGameRecord` (`bridge/replay.ts: readRecord`).
- Replays: archived records contain only human intents; nations and bots re-simulate from the game seed. A record
  replays in sync when no simulation code changed between its `gitCommit` and the pin (v0.34.17-v0.34.21 are
  identical); the hashes it carries every 10 turns decide, not the commit string.
- v0.34.x has no game snapshots. `loadTerrainMap` caches one mutable map per map and size per process, so the bridge
  builds a fresh map for every game (`bridge/maps.ts: loadFreshTerrain`) and resets the game's cross-game static
  fields before each game (`resetGameStatics`); several games can then share a worker process. On every upgrade, grep
  `src/core` for non-readonly `private static` fields and add new ones to `resetGameStatics`.
- Code that only builds observations may use `Math.*`; code whose output reaches the simulation (intents, latency)
  must use seeded `PseudoRandom`.
