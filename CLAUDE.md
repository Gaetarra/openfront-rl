# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Deep-RL bot for OpenFront.io. The design, phases, gates and every decision taken so far are in `docs/PLAN.md`:
read it before starting new work, and update it when a decision changes.

## Conventions

- Commits and PRs are authored by the repo owner. **Never add `Co-Authored-By: Claude` or any other Claude
  attribution line to commit messages or PR descriptions.**
- Never edit anything inside the game submodule `OpenFront_Source_Code/openfrontio/`. It must stay a clean checkout of
  an official release tag. Our code lives in `bridge/` (TypeScript), `trainer/` (Python) and `scripts/`.
- Game rule values (costs, ranges, radii, speeds) are read from the game's `Config` at runtime, never hard-coded,
  so balance patches flow through automatically.

## Game version

The submodule is pinned to the production release the official servers run (currently `v0.34.17`, commit `59da4bc1`).
Check what production runs by reading `gitCommit` from a recent record:
`https://api.openfront.io/public/game/<id>?turns=false` (list games via `/public/games`, see the game's `docs/API.md`).
To upgrade, follow the playbook in `docs/PLAN.md` (decision 14): diff `src/core` between the tags, move the submodule,
run the bridge tests and determinism check, then fine-tune from the latest checkpoint.

## Game commands (run inside `OpenFront_Source_Code/openfrontio/`)

```bash
npm run inst                                   # install deps (npm ci --ignore-scripts); never use npm install
npm run perf:game -- --map world --ticks 1800 --bots 400    # headless full-game benchmark
npm run replay:game -- <gameID|record.json> --api-base https://api.openfront.io/public   # re-simulate a record, verify hashes
npx vitest tests/SomeTest.test.ts --run        # one game test file
```

The game has its own `CLAUDE.md` with details on its architecture.

## Simulation facts the bridge relies on

- 10 ticks = 1 s of game time. One turn is executed per tick.
- Stepping: `createGameRunner(gameStart, clientID, mapLoader, callback)` (`src/core/GameRunner.ts`), then per tick
  `runner.addTurn({ turnNumber, intents })` and `runner.executeNextTick()`. Intents are `StampedIntent`s
  (intent + the player's `clientID`), defined in `src/core/Schemas.ts`.
- Use `GameType.Private` or `Public` for training games: Singleplayer has no spawn timer.
- Determinism: the core uses `PseudoRandom` (never `Math.random`) and `src/core/DetMath.ts` instead of
  `Math.exp/log/pow/atan2`. Anything we add that feeds the simulation must follow the same rules.
- Ownership: `game.map().tileStateBuffer()` is a live `Uint16Array` (owner = `v & 0xFFF`, fallout = bit 13).
  Read it only between ticks.
- Replays: archived records contain only human intents; nations and bots re-simulate from the game seed. A record
  only replays in sync at its exact `gitCommit`.
- v0.34.x has no game snapshots, and `loadTerrainMap` caches one mutable map per map and size per process, so run
  one game per Node process until a release ships per-game fresh maps.
